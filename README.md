# 🫀 AI-Based Heart Disease Prediction

This project was developed as a final academic project for CSIS 260 – Introduction to Artificial Intelligence. It explores a structured machine learning pipeline to predict heart disease using clinical and lifestyle-related features from the `heart_disease.csv` dataset.

---

## 🎓 Project Overview

- **Goal**: Predict whether a person has heart disease based on medical and lifestyle features.
- **Approach**: Data preprocessing, feature analysis, PCA, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning.
- **Models used**:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
  - XGBoost (Phase 2)

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- PCA-based dimensionality reduction
- Comparison of 4 model types
- Balanced vs. unbalanced dataset performance
- L1 regularization
- Hyperparameter tuning:
  - GridSearchCV
  - RandomizedSearchCV
  - BayesSearchCV
- Confusion matrices, F1-scores, AUC comparisons
